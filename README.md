# Hybrid Binning Wengan (HBW)

HBW is a repository hold code for implementing trio-based binning and bubble graph approaches to diploid assembly but for hybrid genomic datasets and tailored for the [Wengan](https://github.com/adigenova/wengan) assembler.


## trio binning

The code under the trio-binning directory implement a novel machine learning algorithm to classify reads into paternal/maternal prior Wengan assembly.

## bubble

The code under the bubble directory implement a novel pipeline for building partially haplotype-resolved sequences starting from a collapsed Wengan assembly.
